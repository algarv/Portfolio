**Projects**

---

**Making Pancakes with a Franka Emika Panda Robot** In Progress

* Utilized MoveIt Python interface and a ROS action client to to grasp a squeeze bottle, move it over a griddle, invert it, apply pressure to dispense batter, and return it to its original location
* Calibrated a RealSense camera to transform coordinates into the robot frame and generate target trajectories to pick-up tools
* Maintained a Git repository to manage contributions from 4 teammates working on 5 interconnected sub-tasks

**Finding and Grabbing a Pen with a PincherX 100 Robot** September 2021

* Utilized OpenCV with a RealSense depth camera to identify a pen based on pixel color and find the estimated center point
* Calculated target joint angles using data from the Realsense  and implemented single joint control to move to the identified target

**Designing an Endotracheal Tube Support Device to Reduce Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries** Dec. 2020 - June 2021


* Sought-out and surveyed 7 stakeholders to hone in on an unmet clinical need and define design constraints 
* Prototyped using Solidworks CAD and Polyjet and SLA 3D printers through 4 iterations
* Tested applied force on the device using an Arduino microcontroller and simulated the resulting material fatigue with FEA analysis
* Awarded** Outstanding Senior Design Project **for developing a functional prototype that uniquely solves a demonstrated need
