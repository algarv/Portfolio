**Experience**

---


**Robotic Applications Intern - Hello Robot** Martinez, CA  June - Sept. 2022



* Collaborated closely with an occupational therapist, acting as R&D and tech support for a field study exploring the use of Stretch, a mobile manipulator designed for home assistive use, in the home of a disabled individual and their care partner
* Implemented and debugged an open source web-based user interface for Stretch in collaboration with an interdisciplinary team
* Created new features including navigating to poses relative to ArUco tags, voice commands, and a robot-lead exercise routine
* Designed and 3D printed custom tools to promote the use of Stretch for daily tasks, including a spinning playing card holder, an arm-mounted dinner service tray, and a letter board holder for hands-free communication

**Research Assistant - Orthopedic Biomechanics Laboratory**	UC Davis Medical Center Sept. 2018 - Sept. 2021



* Created and implemented a Python program to automate data collection and significantly improve the efficiency of data analysis
* Developed a protocol to consistently measure anatomical alignment variables and processed the intake images for 30 patients
* Built a MATLAB program to model knee implant instability
* Designed and prototyped a dual x-ray exposure switch box using Solidworks and 3D printing
* Second author on three publications (Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, Journal of Biomechanics)

**President - Biomedical Engineering Society Undergraduate Chapter** UC Davis Sept. 2017 - June 2021

Previous: Vice President, Mentor/Mentee Program Chair


* Managed a 16 officer team for a club with over 200 members, focussing on strengthening the community through new student outreach, collaborating with administration, organizing a career exploration conference and other targeted events
* Won the **BMES Outstanding Mentoring Program Award** and presented ‘Best Practices’ at the 2019 BMES Annual Meeting 

**Intern - UC Davis Biomedical Engineering Department Summer Innovation Internship** UCDMC & VMTH June 2018 - Aug. 2018


* Acted as a student observer while immersed in six different medical and veterinary clinics and practiced biomedical needs finding within a clinical setting, evaluating workflow, procedures, and devices, ultimately working towards developing needs statements

**Projects**

---


**Adaptive Ankle Exoskeleton Controller** March - Dec. 2022



* Developing a control system with ROS that adapts to user ability to assist rehabilitation with a Technaid H3 ankle exoskeleton
* Utilizing machine learning methods to map multi-muscle high density EMG data to joint torque
* Implementing interaction torque control to improve transparency with a model-based controller

**Ball Balancing Robot** Jan. - March 2022



* Designed and built a ball balancing robot from scratch, prototyping the chassis through several iterations using Solidworks CAD software, 3D printing, and laser cutting
* Researched, selected, and assembled electronic components and programmed an RP2040 microcontroller to control 3 stepper motors with PID control using the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK in C 

**Making Pancakes with a Franka Emika Panda Robot** Dec. 2021

* Integrated contributions from 4 teammates to successfully automate pancake making from batter to plate 
* Utilized MoveIt Python interface, ROS action clients, April tags and OpenCV to to grasp a squeeze bottle, move it over a griddle, invert it, apply pressure to dispense batter, detect when the pancake is ready to flip, flip the pancake, and finally transfer to a plate
