<p>I am a high-energy, motivated masters student interested in biomechanics, assistive technology, medical robotics, and making these technologies smarter. Orthopedic research first introduced me to the exciting intersection of engineering and healthcare, and I explored my excitement for data-informed, engineering-centered healthcare further with Sports Medicine. I love tinkering with coding and microcontroller projects, and am thrilled to be a part of Northwesternâ€™s Masters of Science in Robotics 2021-22 cohort.</p>
