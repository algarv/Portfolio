**Projects**

---


**Making Pancakes with a Franka Emika Panda Robot** Nov. 2021



* Utilized MoveIt motion planning software and an action client to grasp a squeeze bottle, move it over a griddle, invert it, apply pressure to dispense batter, and return it to its original location
* Leveraged transform broadcasters to convert bottle coordinates from a RealSense camera frame to a target trajectory
* Maintained a Git repository to manage contributions from 4 teammates working on 5 interconnected sub-tasks

**Designing an Endotracheal Tube Support Device to Reduce Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries** Dec. 2020 - June 2021

* Sought-out and surveyed 7 stakeholders to hone in on an unmet clinical need and define design constraints 
* Prototyped using Solidworks CAD and Polyjet and SLA 3D printers through 4 iterations
* Tested applied force on the device using an Arduino microcontroller and simulated the resulting material fatigue with FEA analysis
* Awarded **Outstanding Senior Design Project** for developing a functional prototype that provides a high-potential, unique solution to a demonstrated need
