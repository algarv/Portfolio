ROS / Machine Learning / Python


As part of Professor Jose Pons' Neurorehabilitation and Neural Engineering Laboratory I helped developed the framework for an adaptive ankle exoskeleton controller intended for stroke rehabilitation. Specifically, I built the pipeline to predict joint torque in real-time from high-density EMG measurements.

### Project Goals

| | | 
|--|--|
| ![Technaid H3 Ankle Exoskeleton](https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/technaid_h3_ankle.jpg) | * Build the data pipeline to stream high-density EMG signals from the OTB Quattrocento and torque measurements from the H3 Ankle exoskeleton and perform the necessary processing steps such that a model can be fit to predict torque from the processed EMG readings  
* Integrate the existing convolutional neural net (CNN) into the real-time framework to predict torque from cumulative spike train (CST) estimations and compare with the method using root-mean-square emg (RMS EMG) data 
* Prepare a user-friendly and modular ROS package so future researchers can continue to develop more complex protocols |
