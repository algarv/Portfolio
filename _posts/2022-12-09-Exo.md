ROS / Machine Learning / Python


As part of Professor Jose Pons' Neurorehabilitation and Neural Engineering Laboratory I helped developed the framework for an adaptive ankle exoskeleton controller intended for stroke rehabilitation. Specifically, I built the pipeline to predict joint torque in real-time from high-density EMG measurements.

### Project Goals

![Technaid H3 Ankle Exoskeleton](https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/technaid_h3_ankle.jpg)

* Build the data pipeline to stream high-density EMG signals from the OTB Quattrocento and torque measurements from the H3 Ankle exoskeleton and perform the necessary processing steps such that a model can be fit to predict torque from the processed EMG readings  
* Integrate the existing convolutional neural net (CNN) into the real-time framework to predict torque from cumulative spike train (CST) estimations and compare with the method using root-mean-square emg (RMS EMG) data 
* Prepare a user-friendly and modular ROS package so future researchers can continue to develop more complex protocols |

### Outcomes

* Proof of Concept
    * This package establishes a foundation for real-time torque prediction from high-density EMG
* Adaptation of existing methodologies to the quirks of this system
* Understanding tradeoffs of CST and RMS EMG Methods
    * CST requires less data processing but is more sensitive to signal quality, while RMS EMG requires more processing but can handle lower signal to noise ratios. 
Piloting with n=4


### Future Work

* Transparency controller / interaction force control
* New models and learning methods
* Dynamic tasks and eventually walking
* Progress to data from stroke patients
