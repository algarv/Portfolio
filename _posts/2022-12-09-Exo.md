As part of Professor Jose Pons' Neurorehabilitation and Neural Engineering Laboratory I helped developed the framework for an adaptive ankle exoskeleton controller intended for stroke rehabilitation. Specifically, I built the pipeline to predict joint torque in real-time from high-density EMG measurements.

### Project Goals

<p align="center">
<img src="https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/technaid_h3_ankle.jpg" width="400">
</p>

* Build the data pipeline to stream high-density EMG signals from the OTB Quattrocento and torque measurements from the H3 Ankle exoskeleton and perform the necessary processing steps such that a model can be fit to predict torque from the processed EMG readings  
* Integrate the existing convolutional neural net (CNN) into the real-time framework to predict torque from cumulative spike train (CST) estimations and compare with the method using root-mean-square emg (RMS EMG) data 
* Prepare a user-friendly and modular ROS package so future researchers can continue to develop more complex protocols |

### Procedure

There are three primary stages involved in the pipeline for real-time torque prediction.

</p>

1. Data Stream: Manage raw signals from the OTB Quattrocento high-density EMG bioelectrical amplifier and the Technaid h3 ankle exoskeleton. 
    
    * The exoskeleton is ROS compatible and publishes sensor data to a topic with custom message types, allowing for the ROS nodes to access this information directly. To access the data from the Quattrocento, there is an intermediate ROS node that sets-up up a socket for the data stream and then publishes to a topic used by other nodes. 


2. Calibration: The core of this project. Receive, organize, and process raw data streams to fit a model that estimates torque from muscle activity.
    
    * The calibration procedure starts with the subject sitting comfortably with the right ankle resting with a roughly 90 degree hip angle and 180 degree knee angle.

    ![Set-Up](https://algarv.github.io/Portfolio/assets/images/set-up.jpeg)
    </p>
    
    The subject follows a modular set of tasks that consist of a sequence of 2 maximum voluntary contractions and then a torque trajectory to follow. The ankle exoskeleton is locked at a specified joint angle, and the subject pushes or pulls to generate a joint torque following the target trajectory. The trajectory is configurable in its shape (trapezoidal or sinusoidal), directionality (plantar flexion or dorsiflexion), joint angle, effort level (20% to 75% of the MVC), and duration. The modularity of this step is intended to support future work looking into the optimal combination of these parameters. Throughout the calibration, the subject follows a series of prompts guiding them through the process and receives real-time feedback on a plot tracking applied torque over layed on the target trajectory.

    At the end of the calibration sequence, the node will finish post-processing steps and calculate optimal coefficients to fit a model from the torque and muscle activity data.

3. Real-Time Prediction: Apply the model 

    * Once the calibration sequence is finished, the exoskeleton can be switched to torque control mode so it begins following the torque commands predicted from continuous EMG data collection.

### Outcomes

* Proof of Concept
    * This package establishes a foundation for real-time torque prediction from high-density EMG. It will support many future studies looking into optimizing various aspects of this pipeline.
* Adaptation of existing methodologies to the quirks of this system
    * The data processing and modeling in this project are not novel concepts. However, combining procedures into a functional ROS package that could operate in real-time was a new challenge that required adaptions to existing methodologies to account for the increased signal noise and processing speed requirements.
* Understanding tradeoffs of CST and RMS EMG Methods
    * At its current state, the CST method requires less data processing but is more sensitive to signal quality, while RMS EMG requires more processing but can handle lower signal to noise ratios. Further developments will look into strategies to mitigate noise and decrease processing time in order to improve the effectiveness of both methods. 
* Piloting with n=4
    * By then end of my work, I tested the system on 4 individuals including myself. These trials demonstrated the usability of the package and provided a varied data set to evaluate the prediction methods.
