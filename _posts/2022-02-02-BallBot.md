Mechanical Design / Mechatronics / PID Control

For my winter quarter independent study project, set out to build my own version of a BallBot, a dynamically stable / statically unstable robot. I am designing my bot from CAD to control algorithm, utilizing 3D printing, laser cutting, and C programming on an RP2040 microcontroller.

### Building the Structure and Fundamental Electronics

After printing and assembling the chassis pieces, I mounted the 3 motors with 3 motor drivers and a RP2040 ThingPlus microcontroller and started with the basic control of one motor, working on a script to step one wheel at a time.

### Simultaneous Motor Control

The next step was to simultaneously step three motors. This proved to be a more difficult task than anticipated, as it seemed one motor would interfere with the other's power source. However, after switching to drivers with a higher voltage rating, I was able to step each motor sequentially. 

Once I could send alternating stepping commands to each motor, the base could perform basic directional movement including spinning in place and uniaxial paths (forwards, backwards, sideways).

### Twist Commands

Deriving wheel rotation rate from a twist

To make a truly omnidirectional base, the next step was to follow any twist, which require stepping the motors at different frequencies. I started with the most basic form of a control algorithm, a polling loop that stepped each motor after a calculated number of sleep cycles resulting in a wheel RPM calculated by the omnidirectional base matrix equation.

### Position Control

Once the mobile base was capable of following any twist command, it was time to integrate the IMU sensor and create a closed control loop. In my first iteration, only the accelerometer data from the IMU was used to calculate a roll and pitch, which were then used as inputs to the PD controller. The PD controller outputs an x and y velocity relative to the robot's base frame, which are then converted to wheel speeds and finally step delays using the omnidirectional base equation shown above. 

### Self-Righting

The first milestone on the way to balancing was having the robot self-right itself back to a stable position on a ball. During testing, it became apparent that the motors would need to be stepped much faster in order for the robot to catch itself when the ball is not stabilized.

### Design Adjustments

I redesigned the initial concept and chose to try a much larger ball in order to reduce the angle of lean and therefor the lever arm of the robot's body over its center of mass. This, along with reducing to half steps, resulted in a smoother self-righting action but the wheel stepping was still prohibitively slow.

### Control Adjustments

I tried several different approaches to the control algorithm once it became apparent that a simple polling loop would not step the motors at the required frequency. I initially wanted to create an interrupt for each motor, but system clock-based interrupts did not seem supported by the RP2040. As an alternative, I attempted 3 separate timers, with each frequency updated after every update from the IMU. While this was successful in spinning the wheels much faster, it lost the predictability of the original polling loop and the base no longer moved reliably. This was most likely due to the constant resetting of the timers and the competing operations with no set priorities. Finally, I was able to merge the control strategies and create a single timer at a fixed frequency that then counted the number of cycles since the previous step and compared the count to the calculated step delay. This significantly increased the speed of the wheels without compromising a quick and accurate twist response.

### Sensor Tuning

With the wheels more reactive, noise in the IMU also became more apparent. I started with a rolling average filter, which worked well to smooth the signal and reduce spikes. The rolling average was effective at slower speeds, but with a much more reactive control loop, I wanted to explore more advanced methods of sensor fusion. A complementary filter allowed me to supplement the noisy accelerometer data with the steadier (but driftier) gyroscope data. This significantly reduced the steady state noise from up to +/- 40 degree spikes to +/- 10 degree spikes.
