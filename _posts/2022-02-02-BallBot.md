Mechanical Design / Mechatronics / PID Control

For my winter quarter independent study project, I have set out to build my own version of a BallBot, a dynamically stable / statically unstable robot. I am designing my bot from CAD to control algorithm, utilizing 3D printing, laser cutting, and C programming on an RP2040 microcontroller.

As of February 2nd, my polling loop algorithm is functioning to send step and direction signals to drive three stepper motors at independent velocities to make my chassis an omnidirectional base. Currently, a twist is input manually and the algorithm calculates the corresponding delay time between steps, but the next step is to generate the twist from interpreting the IMU sensor input.
