![Maze Gif](maze.gif)

Me and a team worked together to generate and solve a maze using recursive backtracking. I created the maze graphics using PyGame from the numerical array generated by a teammate's algorithm. The algorithm randomly selects an adjacent position and checks if it is either a wall if it has already been visited. If neither of these conditions are true, the algorithm moves to that position and runs the same checks. If a dead end is reached where all options are walls or previously visitted positions, the squares leading to no movement options are marked as walls and the search algorithm backtracks until a new position can be selected. Each position the alogorithm 'visits' is shown with a blue square, which turns cyan when it is forced to backtrack.
