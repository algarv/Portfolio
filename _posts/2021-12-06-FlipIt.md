I worked with a team of 5 to program a Franka Emika Panda arm to make pancakes as our final project for ME 495: Embedded Systems in Robotics. As a team, we each took charge of a sub task and then worked together to integrate all the components into a fully autonomous product. I specifically was in charge of the batter dispensing task, and was heavily involved in developing strategies to increase the success rate of path planning in MoveIt. I utilized single joint control to include universal waypoints for each task and increase the success rate of path planning to tool locations found using computer vision. I additionally implemented action clients to control the gripper and grasp objects at a specified width with a given range of force, an element crucial to the reliability and safety of the batter pouring and flipping tasks.
