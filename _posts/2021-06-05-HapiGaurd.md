HapiGuard aims to eliminate facial hospital acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs) associated with invasive mechanical ventilation by supporting the endotracheal tube (ETT) without creating pressure points on the skin. Pressure injuries increase the risk of infection, patient discomfort, cost of care, and length of hospital stays, making these injuries a crucial problem to address. Current methods to support endotracheal tubes still involve multiple skin contact points, while  HapiGuard eliminates the risk for skin damage entirely with a completely oral design. HapiGuard is designed to be simple to implement and have a universal fit for both the patient and the ETT size to alleviate the burden of pressure injury prevention from overworked nurses in crowded ICUs.
